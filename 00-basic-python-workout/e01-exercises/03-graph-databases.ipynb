    "Graphs have been studied by mathematicians for centuries. As a result we can give a very concise and consistent definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ A **graph** is a set of vertices (plural for vertex) and edges.\n",
    "+ A **vertex** is a point in a graph where zero or more edges meet. Vertices are often referred to as **nodes** or **entities**.\n",
    "+ An **edge** is a relationship between two vertices within a graph, sometimes called a **relationship**, **link**, or **connection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs are extremely simple to illustrate. Graph diagrams usually consist of circles representing vertices and lines representing edges.\n",

    "### What is a graph database?\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph database is a data-storage engine that combines the basic graph structures of vertices (node) and edges (relationship/link) with a persistence technology and a traversal (query) language to create a database optimized for storage and fast retrieval of highly connected data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationships in relational databases are foreign keys, which are pointers to primary keys in other tables. These pointers are not things we can observe and manipulate easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, graph databases represent these associations as full-fledged constructs of the database that can be easily observed and manipulated: in a graph database edges are \"first-class citizens\" just like the vertices."
